Guidelines to create a regression test:
1. create a subdirectory and name it properly:

  <steady/unsteady>_method_app_somethingelse

Note: the directory name MUST contains "steady" or "unsteady"
as the first part because this is picked up by the cmake globbing.

2. add a "main.py" inside the test directory.
You can have multiple mains but make sure you name them uniquely.

3. add other files needed for the test, e.g. inputs, basis files, etc

ATTENTION:
* IF you are using one of the apps inside the pressio4py/apps dir,
your "main.py" file should have the following lines at the top:

  import pathlib, sys
  file_path = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute()
  sys.path.append(str(file_path) + "/../apps")

because the apps directory is needed to access the apps inside.

* If you need to read auxiliary files that you add to the directory,
in your main.py you need to do like this:

  import pathlib, sys
  file_path = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute()
  ...
  ...
  mybasisFile = str(file_path) + "/basis_euler.txt")
  phi = np.loadtxt(mybasisFile)

This is needed for the interpreter otherwise the file is not found.


--------------------------------------------------------------
This is it! What happens then?
When you configure, the cmakelist automatically globs over
the directories and creates the tests, and uses the directory name
and the main file to generate a test name that is unique.
