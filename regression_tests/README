Guidelines to create a regression test:
1. create a subdirectory and name it properly:

  <steady/unsteady>_method_app_somethingelse

Note: the directory name MUST contains "steady" or "unsteady".

2. add a "test_<some_name>_main.py" inside the test directory.
You can have multiple mains but make sure you name them uniquely.
And make sure the file starts with "test_"

3. add other files needed for the test, e.g. inputs, basis files, etc

--------------------------------------------------------------
This is it! What happens then?
When you configure, the cmakelist automatically globs over
the directories and creates the tests, and uses the directory name
and the main file to generate a test name that is unique.
