Note that if you get an import error, it might be that the version of {\ttfamily pytest} you are using is not compatible with the {\ttfamily pip} command you used to install. Make sure you use Python commands from the {\bfseries{same}} distribution.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md60}{}\doxysection{In a nutshell}\label{index_autotoc_md60}
Pressio can be applied to any dynamical system expressible in a {\itshape continuous-\/time} form as \[ \frac{d \boldsymbol{y}}{dt} = \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{y},t; ...) \] and/or in a {\itshape discrete-\/time} form \[ \boldsymbol{R}(\boldsymbol{y}, \boldsymbol{y_{n-1}}, ..., t_n, dt_n; ...) = \boldsymbol{0} \]

Here, $y$ is the full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $f$ the F\+OM velocity, $t$ is time, and $R$ is the residual.

This formulation is quite general and does not make any assumption on its origin\+: it may be derived from the spatial discretization (regardless of the discretization method) of a P\+DE problem, or from naturally discrete systems.

We leverage this expressive mathematical framework as a pivotal design choice to enable a minimal application programming interface (A\+PI) that is natural to dynamical systems\+: you choose the formulation more convenient to you, and interface your application to Pressio by creating a corresponding {\itshape adapter class} to expose the operators needed for the chosen formulation. In general, you don\textquotesingle{}t need to support both\+: each one has advantages and disadvantages, and sometimes the choice is dictated directly by your native application (for example, in some cases it might be easier to directly expose the discrete-\/time residual).
