This page describes a demo for a reproductive \char`\"{}masked\char`\"{} Galerkin R\+OM applied to a 1D advection-\/diffusion problem using P\+OD modes as basis. The term \char`\"{}mask\char`\"{} refers to using a \char`\"{}trick\char`\"{} to mimic hyper-\/reduction without actually needing to change the origian application. By the end, it should be clear how to setup the problem. The full demo script is \href{https://github.com/Pressio/pressio4py/blob/master/demos/unsteady_masked_galerkin_advdiff1d_pod/main.py}{\texttt{ here.}}

We cover these steps\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item generate of snapshots using the full-\/order model (F\+OM)
\item compute the P\+OD basis
\item create the masking operator
\item execute the R\+OM\+: here we leverage the G\+A\+L\+E\+R\+K\+IN R\+OM to demonstrate a {\itshape reproductive} test, i.\+e., we run the R\+OM using the same physical coefficients, b.\+c., etc.

The key item introduced here is the \char`\"{}masking\char`\"{} operator. In simple words, masking allows us to mimic the effect of the hyper-\/reduction without changing the application code. Hyper-\/reduction is a fundamental part of R\+O\+Ms needed to approximate the F\+OM operators, thus contributing significantly to the computational cost savings. However, the main difficulty of hyper-\/reduction is that it generally is quite intrusive to be done properly.

To briefly explain what hyper-\/reduction, let\textquotesingle{}s look at the most basic form of hyper-\/reduction, namely \char`\"{}collocation\char`\"{}. Consider the following system of $N$f@ ODEs: @f[ \frac{du}{dt} = f(u,x,t) @f] A collocation-based hyper-reduction involves *approximating* the right-hand side by computing @ff()@f only at a subset of grid points. Obviously, the way we compute the locations to select is critical and there are several techniques available to do so. Here, we show a simple example just for demonstration purposes of performing collocation with randomly selected points @m_class{m-block m-warning} @par Note that using the mask to mimic hyper-reduction is only helpful to assess the accuracy but not the computational performance. This is because the "masked" problem still requires the FOM to compute the full kernels. Hyper-reduction becomes computationally very efficient if implemented without the mask, which we will show in subsequent demo. ## FOM Equations The governing equations for this problem are: @f[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (k(u,x) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} ) - a*\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} @f] where $@\+\_\+fakenlk(u,x)=x$^\wedge$4 $, the field is $u(x;t) $, the advection velocity is fixed at $@\+\_\+fakenla=2 $, the spatial coordinate is $x $ and the domain is $(0,1)
