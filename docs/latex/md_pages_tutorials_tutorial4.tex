In \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3.html}{\texttt{ this previous tutorial}} we introduced the {\itshape default Galerkin problem} and explained that it is inefficient for large systems because, at every time step, one has to compute the F\+OM velocity and project it using the basis matrix, both of which scale with the F\+OM degrees of freedom. This implies that even if the reduced system to integrate in time is much smaller, the computational gains are practically zero becuase of the above bottleneck.

To overcome this obstacle, one can rely on hyper-\/reduction techniques\+: hyper-\/reduction aims at approximating the F\+OM nonlinear operators for a fraction of the computational cost. There are several hyper-\/reduction methods available (todo, cite).

A key aspect of hyper-\/reduction is that to get the most benefits out of it from a computational cost viewpoint, one has to implement it directly inside the F\+OM code. In practice, oversimplifying a bit, we can say that at its core, it involves enabling the F\+OM code to compute the F\+OM velocity at only a subset of the mesh. A few questions then arise\+: why should one risk investing the time in implementing such technique without assessing upfront whether it will work? how can one evaluate and compare different hyper-\/reduction techniques without modifying the F\+OM code?



\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
pressio4py provides a variant of the Galerkin problem, called {\itshape masked Galerkin}, that allows one to test and compare the {\itshape accuracy} of various hyper-\/reduction techniques {\bfseries{without}} having to change the F\+OM code.
\end{DoxyParagraph}


\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This tutorial introduces the concept of the {\itshape mask} by showing how to construct a masked Galerkin problem using the most basic hyper-\/reduction technique, namely {\itshape collocation}.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial4_autotoc_md76}{}\doxysection{Masked Galerkin with collocation}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial4_autotoc_md76}
In pressio4py, a {\itshape masked Galerkin} with collocation problem is defined as\+: \[ \dot{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(t;\mathbf{\mu}) = \mathbf{(A\phi)}^T A\mathbf{f} \Big(\mathbf{y}_{ref}(\mathbf{\mu}) + \mathbf{\phi}\hat{\mathbf{y}} \Big) \]

where $\hat{y}$ is the reduced state, $y$ is the full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $y_{ref}$ is a reference F\+OM state, $\phi$ is the orthonormal basis, $f(...)$ is the F\+OM velocity and $A$ is a sampling matrix that picks only target rows of $\phi$ and $f$. Note that the only difference with the Galerkin formulation presented in \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3.html}{\texttt{ this tutorial}} is the presence of the sampling operator $A$.

Schematically, the system above corresponds to the figure below. 

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
To define the sampling matrix there are various techniques (todo, add reference to pressio-\/tools etc). The most basic one is just random sampling\+: given the set of indices of the full mesh, one simply randomly picks a subset of it.
\end{DoxyParagraph}


\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Note that to access the masking functionality you don\textquotesingle{}t need to change the F\+OM application. This is because the F\+OM always handles the full operators, and the masking is applied {\itshape after} the F\+OM computes the velocity. In other words, to access the masked Galerkin you can use the same F\+OM object you use for the default Galerkin problem discussed in \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3.html}{\texttt{ this tutorial}}.

In practice, a {\itshape masked} Galerkin problem needs the following main steps\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item creating the decoder on the {\bfseries{F\+U\+LL}} mesh 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{\# e.g. let phi contain the POD modes on the full mesh}}
\DoxyCodeLine{linearDecoder = rom.Decoder(phi)}
\end{DoxyCode}

\item selecting the row indices to use for the collocation 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{\# as anticipated above, there are various methods to select indices,}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{\# the most basic one is random sampling}}
\DoxyCodeLine{collocationIndices = np.array([2,3,10,56, whatever])}
\end{DoxyCode}

\item creating a \char`\"{}projector operator\char`\"{} that is responsible to project the F\+OM velocity. Basically, this projector knows how to compute the action of $(A\phi)^T$. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{modesOnSampleMesh = np.take(modes, collocationIndices, axis=0)}
\DoxyCodeLine{projector = rom.galerkin.ArbitraryProjector(modesOnSampleMesh)}
\end{DoxyCode}

\item creating a masker object\+: the masker is responsible to act on the F\+OM velocity vector and \char`\"{}mask\char`\"{} it to return the collocated values. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class }MyMasker:}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{keyword}{def }\_\_init\_\_(self, indices):}
\DoxyCodeLine{    self.rows\_ = indices}
\DoxyCodeLine{    self.collocationSize\_ = len(indices)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{keyword}{def }createApplyMaskResult(self, operand):}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{keywordflow}{return} np.zeros(self.collocationSize\_)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{keyword}{def }applyMask(self, operand, time, result):}
\DoxyCodeLine{    result[:] = np.take(operand, self.rows\_)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{masker = MyMasker(collocationIndices)}
\end{DoxyCode}

\item creating the masked Galerkin problem
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{problem = rom.galerkin.masked.ProblemForwardEuler(fomObj,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                                  linearDecoder,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                                  romState,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                                  fomReferenceState,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                                  masker,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                                  projector)}
