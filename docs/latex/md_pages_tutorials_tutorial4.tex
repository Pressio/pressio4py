In \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3.html}{\texttt{ this previous tutorial}} we introduced the {\itshape default Galerkin problem} and explained that it is inefficient for large systems because, at every time step, one has to compute the F\+OM velocity and project it using the basis matrix, both of which scale with the F\+OM degrees of freedom. This implies that even if the reduced system to integrate in time is much smaller, the computational gains are practically zero becuase of the above bottleneck.

To overcome this obstacle, one can rely on hyper-\/reduction techniques\+: hyper-\/reduction aims at approximating the F\+OM nonlinear operators for a fraction of the computational cost. There are several hyper-\/reduction methods available (todo, cite).

A key aspect of hyper-\/reduction is that to get the most benefits out of it from a computational cost viewpoint, one has to implement it directly inside the F\+OM code. In practice, oversimplifying a bit, we can say that at its core, it involves enabling the F\+OM code to compute the F\+OM velocity at only a subset of the mesh. A few questions then arise\+: why should one risk investing the time in implementing such technique without assessing upfront whether it will work? how can one evaluate and compare different hyper-\/reduction techniques without modifying the F\+OM code?

pressio4py provides a variant of the Galerkin problem, called {\itshape masked Galerkin}, that allows one to test and compare the {\itshape accuracy} of various hyper-\/reduction techniques {\bfseries{without}} having to change the F\+OM code.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This tutorial aims at introducing the concept of the {\itshape mask} by showing how to construct a masked Galerkin problem using the most basic hyper-\/reduction technique, namely {\itshape collocation}.

\hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial4_autotoc_md76}{}\doxysection{Masked Galerkin with collocation}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial4_autotoc_md76}
pressio4py defines a {\itshape masked Galerkin} with collocation a problem as\+: \[ \dot{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(t;\mathbf{\mu}) = \mathbf{(A\phi)}^T A\mathbf{f} \Big(\mathbf{y}_{ref}(\mathbf{\mu}) + \mathbf{\phi}\hat{\mathbf{y}} \Big) \]

where $\hat{y}$ is the reduced state, $y$ is the full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $y_{ref}$ is a reference F\+OM state, $\phi$ is the orthonormal basis, $f(...)$ is the F\+OM velocity and \$fA $ is a sampling matrix that picks only target rows of @$f\phi$ and \$ff $. Schematically, this system corresponds to the figure below. <!-- @image html tut_gal_1_f2.png width=65% --> <!-- In practice, to use a *masked* Galerkin problem one needs: --> <!-- 1. a FOM object satisfying the API described [here](file:///Users/fnrizzi/Desktop/work/ROM/gitrepos/pressio4py/docs/html/md_pages_prepare_your_app.html): note that this is a regular FOM, nothing needs to change --> <!-- 2. a linear decoder (see [this tutorial](./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1.html)) --> <!-- 3. a masker object: the role of the ma --> <!-- pressio4py supports different variants of Galerkin, as we will show in subsequent tutorials. --> <!-- The "default" qualification in pressio4py refers to a --> <!-- formulation that does *not* use hyper-reduction. --> <!-- Suppose that your full-order model (FOM) is written as --> <!-- @f[ --> <!-- \frac{d \boldsymbol{y}}{dt} = --> <!-- \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{y},t; \boldsymbol{\mu}), --> <!-- \quad \boldsymbol{y}(0;\boldsymbol{\mu}) = \boldsymbol{y}(\boldsymbol{\mu}), --> <!-- @f] --> <!-- where $@\+\_\+fakenly $ is the FOM state and $f(...) $ is the FOM velocity. --> <!-- Both $@\+\_\+fakenly $ and $f $ are large, see figure below. --> <!-- @image html tut_gal_1_f1.png width=30% --> <!-- @m_class{m-block m-info} --> <!-- @par Default Galerkin --> <!-- pressio4py defines a *default Galerkin* problem as: --> <!-- @f[ --> <!-- \dot{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(t;\mathbf{\mu}) = --> <!-- \mathbf{\phi}^T --> <!-- \mathbf{f} --> <!-- \Big(\mathbf{y}_{ref}(\mathbf{\mu}) --> <!-- + \mathbf{\phi}\hat{\mathbf{y}} \Big) --> <!-- @f] --> <!-- where $\textbackslash{}hat\{y\} $ is the reduced state, also called generalized coordinates, --> <!-- $@\+\_\+fakenly $ is the full-order model (FOM) state, --> <!-- $@\+\_\+fakenly\+\_\+\{ref\} $ is a reference FOM state, $\textbackslash{}phi $ is the orthonormal basis, and --> <!-- $@\+\_\+fakenlf(...)
