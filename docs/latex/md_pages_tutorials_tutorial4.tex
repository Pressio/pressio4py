In \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3.html}{\texttt{ this tutorial}} we introduced the {\itshape default Galerkin problem} and explained that it is inefficient for large systems because ones has to compute the F\+OM velocity and project it using the basis matrix, both of which scale with the F\+OM degrees of freedom. This implies that even if the reduced system to integrate in time is much smaller, the computational gains are practically zero becuase of the above bottleneck.

To overcome this obstacle, one typically resorts to hyper-\/reduction techniques. Hyper-\/reduction aims at approximating the F\+OM nonlinear operators for a fraction of the computational cost. There are several hyper-\/reduction methods available and this tutorial is not aimed at presenting all of them.

A key aspect of hyper-\/reduction is that to get the most benefits out of it, one has to implement it directly inside the F\+OM code. We can say that, in practice, it boils down to enabling the F\+OM code to computing the F\+OM velocity at only a subset of the mesh. So
