In \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3.html}{\texttt{ this tutorial}} we explained that using a default Galerkin problem is inefficient for large problems because ones has to compute the F\+OM velocity and project it using the basis matrix, both of which scale with the F\+OM degrees of freedom. To overcome this obstacle, one resorts to hyper-\/reduction techniques, which aim at approximating the F\+OM nonlinear operators for a fraction of the computational cost.
