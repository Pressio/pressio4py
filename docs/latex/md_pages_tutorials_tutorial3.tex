pressio4py supports different variants of Galerkin, as we will show in subsequent tutorials. The \char`\"{}default\char`\"{} qualification refers to a formulation that does {\itshape not} use hyper-\/reduction. In practice, a {\itshape default Galerkin} problem corresponds to solving the following problem\+:

\[ \dot{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(t;\mathbf{\mu}) = \mathbf{\phi}^+ \mathbf{f} \Big(\mathbf{y}_{ref}(\mathbf{\mu}) + \mathbf{\phi}\hat{\mathbf{y}} \Big) \]

where $\hat{y}$ is the reduced state, also called generalized coordinates, $y$ is the full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $y_{ref}$ is the reference F\+OM state, $\phi$ is the basis, and $f(.)$ is the F\+OM velocity.
