pressio4py supports different variants of Galerkin, as we will show in subsequent tutorials. The \char`\"{}default\char`\"{} qualification in pressio4py refers to a formulation that does {\itshape not} use hyper-\/reduction. Suppose that your full-\/order model (F\+OM) is written as \[ \frac{d \boldsymbol{y}}{dt} = \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{y},t; \boldsymbol{\mu}), \quad \boldsymbol{y}(0;\boldsymbol{\mu}) = \boldsymbol{y}(\boldsymbol{\mu}), \]

where $y$ is the F\+OM state and $f(...)$ is the F\+OM velocity. Note that here both $y$ and $f$ are large, see figure below. 

pressio4py defines a {\itshape default Galerkin} problem to be \[ \dot{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(t;\mathbf{\mu}) = \mathbf{\phi}^T \mathbf{f} \Big(\mathbf{y}_{ref}(\mathbf{\mu}) + \mathbf{\phi}\hat{\mathbf{y}} \Big) \]

where $\hat{y}$ is the reduced state, also called generalized coordinates, $y$ is the full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $y_{ref}$ is a reference F\+OM state, $\phi$ is the orthonormal basis, and $f(...)$ is the F\+OM velocity. \hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3_autotoc_md70}{}\doxysection{How to create a default Galerkin problem?}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3_autotoc_md70}
Here we focus on explicit time integration, leaving the implicit one for a different tutorial. To create a Galerkin problem, one needs\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item a F\+OM object to compute the velocity satisfying the A\+PI described \href{file:///Users/fnrizzi/Desktop/work/ROM/gitrepos/pressio4py/docs/html/md_pages_prepare_your_app.html}{\texttt{ here}};
\item a linear decoder object (see \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1.html}{\texttt{ this tutorial}});
\item a rom state
\item a F\+OM reference state
