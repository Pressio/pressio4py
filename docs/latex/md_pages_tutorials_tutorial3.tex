pressio4py supports different variants of Galerkin, as we will show in subsequent tutorials. The \char`\"{}default\char`\"{} qualification in pressio4py refers to a formulation that does {\itshape not} use hyper-\/reduction. Suppose that your full-\/order model (F\+OM) is written as \[ \frac{d \boldsymbol{y}}{dt} = \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{y},t; \boldsymbol{\mu}), \quad \boldsymbol{y}(0;\boldsymbol{\mu}) = \boldsymbol{y}(\boldsymbol{\mu}), \]

where $y$ is the F\+OM state and $f(...)$ is the F\+OM velocity. Both $y$ and $f$ are large, see figure below. 



\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Default Galerkin}
pressio4py defines a {\itshape default Galerkin} problem as\+: \[ \dot{\hat{\mathbf{y}}}(t;\mathbf{\mu}) = \mathbf{\phi}^T \mathbf{f} \Big(\mathbf{y}_{ref}(\mathbf{\mu}) + \mathbf{\phi}\hat{\mathbf{y}} \Big) \]
\end{DoxyParagraph}
where $\hat{y}$ is the reduced state, also called generalized coordinates, $y$ is the full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $y_{ref}$ is a reference F\+OM state, $\phi$ is the orthonormal basis, and $f(...)$ is the F\+OM velocity. \hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3_autotoc_md70}{}\doxysection{How to create a default Galerkin problem?}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3_autotoc_md70}
Here we focus on explicit time integration, leaving the implicit one for a different tutorial. To create a Galerkin problem, one needs\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item a F\+OM object satisfying the A\+PI described \href{file:///Users/fnrizzi/Desktop/work/ROM/gitrepos/pressio4py/docs/html/md_pages_prepare_your_app.html}{\texttt{ here}};
\item a linear decoder object (see \href{./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1.html}{\texttt{ this tutorial}});
\item a rom state
\item a F\+OM reference state
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Synopsis\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{problem = rom.galerkin.default.ProblemForwardEuler(fomObj, decoder, yRom, yRef)}
\end{DoxyCode}


Here we highlight that the problem class is within the {\ttfamily default} module and how the time-\/stepping scheme is part of the class name. This stems from the fact that the Python bindings are built from the C++ library, which is heavy on templates, thus leading to this solution.

To use a different time stepping scheme, one can simply change the last part of the class name. We currently support forward Euler and 4th-\/order Runge Kutta. For R\+K4, one would do\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{problem = rom.galerkin.default.ProblemRK4(fomObj, decoder, yRom, yRef)}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3_autotoc_md71}{}\doxysection{How to solve a default Galerkin problem?}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial3_autotoc_md71}
Once the problem object is created, the reduced system can be integrated in time. Here we provide the most basic funtion, which advances the system for a fixed number of steps. Synopsis\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{rom.galerkin.advanceNSteps(problem,     \textcolor{comment}{\# problem object}}
\DoxyCodeLine{                           yRom,        \textcolor{comment}{\# rom state to advance}}
\DoxyCodeLine{                           t0,          \textcolor{comment}{\# initial time}}
\DoxyCodeLine{                           dt,          \textcolor{comment}{\# time step}}
\DoxyCodeLine{                           Nsteps       \textcolor{comment}{\# number of steps}}
\DoxyCodeLine{                           [, observer] \textcolor{comment}{\# optional observer (see below)}}
\DoxyCodeLine{                           )}
\end{DoxyCode}


The optional argument allows one to pass an \char`\"{}observer\char`\"{} object whose purpose is to monitor the evolution of the reduced state. The observer is called back by pressio4py during the time integration. This can be useful to, e.\+g., save the generalized coordinates, or perfom some other operation. The observer class must meee the following A\+PI\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class }OdeObserver:}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{keyword}{def }\_\_init\_\_(self): \textcolor{keyword}{pass}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{keyword}{def }\_\_call\_\_(self, timeStep, time, romState):}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{\# do what you want with romState}}
\end{DoxyCode}
