The projector is needed for Galerkin to perform the projection of the FOM operators onto the reduced space.



It is explicitly required from the user when doing \href{md_pages_components_rom_galerkin_masked.html}{\texttt{ maked}} or \href{md_pages_components_rom_galerkin_hypred.html}{\texttt{ hyper-\/reduced}} Galerkin. 

For a \href{md_pages_components_rom_galerkin_default.html}{\texttt{ default}} problem, you don\textquotesingle{}t need to pass it because the projector is constructed behind the scenes automatically using the decoder\textquotesingle{}s jacobian.

When provided by the user, the projector operator must be provided in the form of a functor as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{class }Projector:}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{keyword}{def }\_\_init\_\_(self, ...):}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{\# as needed}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  \textcolor{keyword}{def }\_\_call\_\_(self, operand, time, result):}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \textcolor{comment}{\# project operand and store in result}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that the operand is either a FOM velocity instance, or the decoder\textquotesingle{}s Jacobian. In all cases, however, it is a {\ttfamily numpy.\+array}. You can put define the actual projection operation however you like.

One thing to keep in mind is that, typically, the {\ttfamily operand} is either a masked operand (i.\+e., the result of masking a full FOM operand) if you are using a masked problem, or it is a hyper-\/reduced object if you are using a hyper-\/reduced Galerkin problem.
