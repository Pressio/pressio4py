A key assumption of projection-\/based R\+O\+Ms relies on approximating a full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $y_{fom}$, as\+: \[ y_{fom} = g(y_{rom}) \]

where $y_{rom}$ is the reduced state, also called generalized coordinates, and $g$ is the mapping between the two.

If $g$ is linear, then we can write\+: \[ y_{fom} = \phi y_{rom} \] where $\phi$ is a matrix (for the time being assumed constant). The Jacobian of the mapping is\+: \[ \frac{d y_{fom}}{d y_{rom}} = \phi. \]

A linear decoder in pressio4py represents this linear mapping.

Note that the above expressions are abtract, since they do not specify what kind of data structures are used. pressio4py supports two scenarios\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item the F\+OM and R\+OM states are {\itshape rank-\/1 tensors} (i.\+e., vectors)
\item the F\+OM and R\+OM states are {\itshape rank-\/2 tensors} (i.\+e., matrices)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1_autotoc_md63}{}\doxysection{Rank-\/1 state}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1_autotoc_md63}
The F\+OM state is stored as an array, $y_{fom} \in R^N$, where $N$ = {\bfseries{total number of degrees of freedom}}, while the R\+OM state is stored as an array, $y_{rom} \in R^p$, where $p$ is the number of modes.

In this case, the application possibly involves multiple fields (e.\+g., density, chemical species, etc), but stores all the spatial degrees of freedom in a single array. For example, in a finite-\/volume code, one stores contiguously all field values of a given cell, for all cells. This is common, for example, when the application needs to do implicit time-\/integration such that a large system needed to be solved.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Where can you use the linear decoder with a rank-\/1 state?}
It can be employed for both Galerkin and L\+S\+PG as shown in subsequent tutorials and in the demos.

In this case, the F\+OM state is stored as a matrix, $y_{fom} \in R^{N,m}$, where\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $m$ = the total number of fields. E.\+g., density, x-\/velocity, tracer concentration, etc.
\item $N$ = number of degrees of freedom of each field
\end{DoxyItemize}

This scenario is intended for applications that prefer to separate the degress of freedom, and is more commonly found for explicit time integration.
