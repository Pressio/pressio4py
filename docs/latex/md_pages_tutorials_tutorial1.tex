A key assumption of projection-\/based R\+O\+Ms relies on approximating a full-\/order model (F\+OM) state, $y_{fom}$, as\+: \[ y_{fom} = g(y_{rom}) \]

where $y_{rom}$ is the reduced state, also called generalized coordinates, and $g$ is the mapping between the two.

If $g$ is linear, then we can write\+: \[ y_{fom} = \phi y_{rom} \] where $\phi$ is a matrix (for the time being assumed constant). The Jacobian of the mapping is\+: \[ \frac{d y_{fom}}{d y_{rom}} = \phi. \]

A linear decoder in pressio4py represents this linear mapping.

Note that the above expressions are abtract, since they do not specify what kind of data structures are used. pressio4py supports the following scenarios\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item the F\+OM and R\+OM states are {\itshape rank-\/1 tensors}
\item the F\+OM and R\+OM states are {\itshape rank-\/2 tensors}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1_autotoc_md71}{}\doxysection{Rank-\/1 state}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1_autotoc_md71}
The F\+OM state is stored as an array, $y_{fom} \in R^N$, where $N$ = {\bfseries{total number of degrees of freedom}}, while the R\+OM state is stored as an array, $y_{rom} \in R^p$, where $p$ is the number of modes, see the figure below. 

In this case, even if the application possibly involves multiple fields (e.\+g., density, chemical species, etc), it stores all the spatial degrees of freedom in a single array. For example, in a finite-\/volume code, one stores contiguously all field values of a given cell, for all cells. This is common, for example, when the application needs to do implicit time-\/integration such that a large system needs to be solved.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to setup such linear mapping between rank-\/1 states.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Where can you use the linear decoder with a rank-\/1 state?}
It can be employed for both Galerkin and L\+S\+PG as shown in subsequent tutorials and in the demos.

\hypertarget{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1_autotoc_md72}{}\doxysection{Rank-\/2 state}\label{md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1_autotoc_md72}
Suppose now that an application includes $m$ fields, e.\+g., density, x-\/velocity, tracer concentration, etc, and rather than storing all degrees of freedom in a single array, one wants to keep them separate. This is frequently found when using explicit time integration.

In such case, the F\+OM state can be represented as a tensor, $y_{fom} \in R^{N,m}$ and the R\+OM state is $y_{rom} \in R^{p,m}$, where\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $m$ = the total number of fields. E.\+g., density, x-\/velocity, tracer concentration, etc.
\item $N$ = number of degrees of freedom of each field
\item $p$ = number of modes 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that here we assumed that we also have separate generalized coordinates for each field, each using the same number of modes.

This scenario is intended for applications that prefer to separate the degress of freedom. The code snippet below demonstrates how to setup such linear mapping between rank-\/1 states.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Where can you use the linear decoder with a rank-\/2 state?}
Currently, a linear decoder with rank-\/2 states can only be used for Galerkin with explicit time stepping.
