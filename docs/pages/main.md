You landed on the documentation of the Python bindings library!

If this is a mistake, please go back to the [project website](https://pressio.github.io/).


## Getting Started
Get started as follows:
```bash
export CXX=<path-to-your-C++-compiler>
pip3 install --no-binary :all: -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pressio4py
```

And then you can or look at the [demos](./md_pages_demos_demo1.html).
<!-- read the [building/installation process](./md_pages_getstarted_build_and_install.html)>
<!-- Untill we start filling the tutorials and examples, you can peek at the [test subdirectory](https://github.com/Pressio/pressio/tree/master/tests/rom/burgers1d) of the C++ library. -->
