# Python Bindings for Pressio

*Leading-edge projection-based reduced order models (\proms) for
dynamical systems in science and engineering.*

You landed on the documentation of the Python bindings library!

If this is a mistake, please go back to the [project website](https://pressio.github.io/).


# Get Started

If you want to have pip fully build:

@m_class{m-block m-warning}

@par
```bash
export CXX=<path-to-your-C++-compiler>
pip3 install --no-binary :all: -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ pressio4py
```

Or you can try pip diretly:

@m_class{m-block m-warning}

@par
```bash
pip3 install pressio4py
```

And then you can look at the [demos](./md_pages_demos_demo1.html) and/or
[tutorials](./md_pages_tutorials_tutorial1.html)--- both in progress.

<!-- read the [building/installation process](./md_pages_getstarted_build_and_install.html)>
<!-- Untill we start filling the tutorials and examples, you can peek at the [test subdirectory](https://github.com/Pressio/pressio/tree/master/tests/rom/burgers1d) of the C++ library. -->
